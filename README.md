# CS 710 Final Project
## How to Run
Clone this repository and open **TChappell_FinalProject.R** in RStudio. 

Set working directory to where this directory is stored and code can be run from there.

Data is taken from the **Data** folder. If any updates are made, images for the graphs will be stored in **Images** folder. NOTE: Most text has been removed from the saved graphs so that text size and font is constant in the final visualization. The graphs with the initial text have been left in as a reference for labeling.

## Final Visualization
The final visualization is titled **TChappell_FinalProject.pdf**. It is created by taking the graphs generated from R and formatting them in Adobe Illustrator.
