# CS 710 Final Project
## How to Run
Clone this repository and open "TChappell_FinalProject.R" in RStudio. 

Set working directory to where this directory is stored and code can be run from there.

Data is taken from the "Data" folder. If any updates are made, images for the graphs will be stored in "Images" folder. NOTE: most text is removed from the graphs so that text size and font is constant in the final visualization.

## Final Visualization
The final visualization is titled "TChappell_FinalProject.pdf". It is created by taking the graphs from R and formatted in Adobe Illustrator.
